Making a design that responds to multiple screen sizes is made much easier by BridgeCSS thanks to specific mixins to target different device sizes. 

There are three defined device sizes

- desktop: min-width: 1024px;
- tablet:  min-width: 768px;
- mobile: min-width: 320px;

So to target a set of devices you can write a style like:


```scss
img {
  width: 16px;

  @include tablet {
    width: 20px;
  }
  
  @include desktop {
    width: 30px;
  }
}
```

The nice aspect of this compared to the utility-first style is that you can group all your tablet styles in a single place without having to prefix all of them individually with the size.

Here is an example of how you can dynamically adjust the layout depending on the screen size. (grab the handle on the right size to resize)

*** Example ***

```svelte
<div class="max-w-md mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden md:max-w-2xl">
  <div class="md:flex">
    <div class="md:shrink-0">
      <img class="h-48 w-full object-cover md:h-full md:w-48" src="/img/store.jpg" alt="Man looking at item at a store">
    </div>
    <div class="p-8">
      <div class="uppercase tracking-wide text-sm text-indigo-500 font-semibold">Case study</div>
      <a href="#" class="block mt-1 text-lg leading-tight font-medium text-black hover:underline">Finding customers for your new business</a>
      <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500">Getting a new business off the ground is a lot of hard work. Here are five ideas you can use to find your first customers.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<style lang="scss">
div {
    div {
        .photo {

          }

        .caption {

        }
    }
}
</style>
```

## Mobile First

Since the breakpoints are defined with `min-width` BridgeCSS is naturally mobile first. Eg. using the `@include tablet` selector will then only apply above a certain width.

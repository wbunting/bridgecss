BridgeCSS allows you to build upon the color palette from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). All normal colors from Tailwind are available.

## Palette

## Extending

You can extend the color palette easily by adding your own classes or overriding in the scss file where you improt BridgeCSS to your project.

For example if you load bridge into a file `src/bridge.scss` you can override colors like this:

```scss
// src/bridge.scss

$gray-100: #FFFFFF;
```
